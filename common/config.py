This is exciting news as it means the conference can accept many more presenters and also try to choose what we think the community will want to hear.\n\nAgain, we are excited to have you participate and look forward to seeing you at the Utah Open Source Conference 2008.\n\nCheers,\n\nClint Savage\nFounder, Utah Open Source Foundation\nhttp://utos.org | http://utosc.com"
