The Utah Open Source Foundation (UTOS) started running the Utah Open Source Conference (UTOSC) in September of 2007.  With the success of this conference behind us and not happy with the proprietary solution chosen for conference management, UTOS decided that it would be best if we researched and found a useful open source alternative.  Most of those sucked more than we could handle.

Because of the lack of a *good* conference management system, we thought we'd hack our own, make it free to use and license it with a valid open source license, which we have yet to decide upon.

Hopefully, conman will become *the* open source tool for running conferences.

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------

Django SVN-pre-0.97 (this is the current svn tree)
python >= 2.4
python imaging library (PIL) >= 2.5
sqlite > 3 (development version)
mysql >= 5 (production version)
postgresql  (production version) 
A lot of patience and command line skill

For the production version, settings.py will need to be adjusted to run either postgresql or mysql.


To setup and install ConMan, because it is a Django project, one could consider using the manage.py and running the dev server for testing, or a better way, to use mod_python or fastcgi to deliver the code using apache on the back end.

DEVELOPMENT SERVER (aka the quick-and-dirty-way)

1)  svn co http://utos-conman.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ utos-conman-ro
2)  cd utos-conman-ro
3)  rm testdatabase.db
4)  python manage.py syncdb 
    4a) do not choose to add a admin user
5)  python manage.py loaddata fixtures/initial_data.xml (this step may not work.  Skip if not)
    5a) if step 5 did not work, this will mean a fair amount of data needs to be added 
        in the admin section.  Hop to it!
6)  python manage.py runserver <port>
7)  open a web browser and point it at http://localhost:<port>

PRODUCTION SERVER (aka the read-a-lot-of-mod-python-documentation-way)

There are several good docs on how to setup mod_python or fastcgi.  Below are the ones used by us for our project:

http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Django
http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/modpython/
http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/fastcgi/

In addition to these helpful URLs, there are several setups you will want to add as well.  

* The static/ location needs to be ignored by mod_python
* The admin/ location also has css somewhere inside and needs to be ignored by mod_python
* By default, the login/ location is available, but may or may not be desired

As part of ConMan loaddata process, there is a default user added.  The username/password is: conman/utos, feel free to change it after you login to the admin section.
